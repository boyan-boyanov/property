# BGProperties
My very first React project. 
The project is a basic version of a classifieds site limited to posting real estate ads. The properties are divided into 2 groups (sales, rent) and three categories (apartments, offices, houses).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
